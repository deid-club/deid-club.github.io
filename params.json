But the ambition is to fill it with useful tips and - more importantly - code. \r\nThe world of Clinical Trials experiences an increasing push to share data. With this comes the need to anonymize/de-identify the data, estimate the risk of re-identification and everything in between. \r\nThe aim of this site is to be the First Aid kit for all things Deid. \r\nSo if you've got a piece of code that you would like to share with others, this is the right place.\r\n\r\n### Why share code?\r\nWhen it comes to Deid, standards are scarce, experience is distributed very unevenly, experts are few.\r\n#But if everybody shares a little, we can all benefit a lot. \r\nAnd who knows, if many people use your code it might just become the de-facto standard. And if this gets recognized and approved it will become the standard for the years to come.\r\n\r\n### Code Repo\r\nThe backbone for the Deid.Club is GitHub. The perfect platform to share, develop and maintain code. It opens the door for everyone to chip in, participate and leave their mark. \r\n",
